<h2>My Heartbreak Story</h2>
<hr/>
<h5>
  
  <p>This is me, ESADE BLESSING; do I have a middle name? oh yes, I do, my full name is ESADE, BLESSING OGHENE-EBRUPHIYO, I’m an Urhobo from Delta state, in case this gets outside my country, well then I’m from Nigeria, yeah yeah, don’t get confused please I’m not trying to write a book, I’m just learning how to type. Well let’s see what’s in this head of mine. 
  Hmmmm, ok let me ask a question, to myself though,</p>
  <p>My Brain: Esade blessing, how are you? how’s life treating you? how’s your relationship? I mean romantic relationship (smiley face upside down)?</p> 
  Me: Well, I’ll say I’m fine, maybe, don’t know, hmmm, life is okay, I guess so, and I’m not in any romantic relationship, I jeopardized my last one, or rather self-destruct. 
 <p>My Brain: You don’t seem fine, from your words, it’s obvious you’re just guessing, but I’ll leave that aside, cause I believe in the end everything will be fine, LOL, definitely I’m sure you knew where that line came from , RICK & MORTY, that line isn’t in your dictionary up here, wheeew, thank GOD you watched rick and morty. Can you elaborate more on the self destruct part ? I mean, if you don’t mind.</p> 
 <p>Me: Sure, should I start from the beginning ?</p>
  <p>My Brain: yes, damn this is going to be long.</p> 
 <p>Me: Okay, it all began when the fire nation attacked (LOL), just joking, it was 2021, or rather 2020, I met this girl during GST 101 class, me and my friend victor sat on same sit with her, she was a chubby cute girl, with baby face, she occupied almost the entire sit, I couldn’t keep my mouth shut, so I told her, she’s fat, she turned and looked at me, oh lord , I had to laugh , cause all I was seeing was DONKEY, FROM SHREK, don’t know how, but that’s what I was seeing , I laughed and told her, I thought she would find it annoying but she didn’t , I knew my bad mouth was a quite a conundrum for me then, but she was okay with it, she laughed too, I then asked for her name, she said her name’s EMMANUEL, LAYEFA PRECIOUS, i told her mine also, she was from delta too, we talked about a few stuff, of course we didn’t pay attention to the lecturer anymore, it was fun, for me.
  Next time we saw, we just waved, and said Hi to each other, bla bla bla, . this is getting boring. Lets skip a bit, during the covid 19 break, we became a fond of each other, she promised to visit once school is on session, well she did, after the break she paid me a visit, even though I resisted, cause my house was upside down, my roommate Emma was around, she came, forgot to say this earlier, I’m not good with women, I don’t know how to vibe properly with them, especially when I really like you, she was nice , I mean extremely nice. 
  The next time she visited, the whole house was around, I had 3 roommates plus me making us 4, Kalaku, David, Emma, they all liked her, we were all cool, as friends, ohhh, I’m not skipping this part, we offered her a drink, 1 liter coke, she was like, it’s too much, I can’t finish this, BROOOOO, she finished 1 liter coke, we were f**king surprised, she just laughed about it, okay, I’m saying too much, skip, skip, skip, okay, one day, I called her, to come see me, she came with her friend, but the friend left earlier than expected, gban gban gban, I told her , I liked her, and I want to be my girlfriend, she bluntly said  NO, I asked, why?, she said she had a twin sister, who died, though I didn’t know how being my girlfriend had anything to do with her twin, I didn’t listen though, I was only concerned about the NO, well, from that day, things started getting weird, she said I  was acting all pesky, skip,skip,skip, she had roommate issues , then she asked if she could stay with us, I discussed with my roommates, and surprisingly, they’ll agreed, skip, skip,skip, it was more opportunity for me to persuade her to be my girlfriend. One evening we were all dancing to old songs, we had fun, then later, I saw her and my roommate, Emma on the bed, at first, I was okay with it, then I saw him squeezing her ass, DAMN BRO, I was f**king angry, I got an instant mood swing that evening, the next day, I was going to travel for my Grandpa’s funeral, well, before I left, she was washing, and we were conversing quite well, then, I asked, her If she liked me, it took almost 40 minutes for her to give me the answer she said yes , my mind went KABLOOWIII, then I packed my bag with a face full of smile, ready to go for the journey, told my roomies anything she wanted should be given to her, I’ll pay. 
  During my stay at home, I called regularly to check on her, of course , I was super excited, asked my most trusted roomie, David, to give me Intels, he then shouted, with laughter saying, Emma sleep with your girl for bed, e hug her tight, I took it as a joke , when I returned she wasn’t around, she traveled to her uncle’s house just for the weekend, though she said she’ll come same day as me, then Emma called me aside and told me, he had something with her, he said he was sorry about it, I was like, OKAY, we went inside to eat the stuff I brought from home, few hours later, Laye came, we welcomed her, we all had a nice time together, later around hmmm, 9pm she said she wants to speak with me, privately, we spoke, she told me she had something with Emma, I said it Was fine, since it’s a mistake, she was kinda surprised, ok ok skip, skip, skip,
  Jesus, typing is hard damn…,
  We started dating, it was so f**king nice, hey hey, NO +18 content here, so back off , LOL.
  I got to find out about her Ex , Ifeanyi, he was my senior in the department, fair, handsome dude, oh oh , I forgot to mention, I look like a clown, I have trapezium head, I’m skinny and tiny, Also I’m dark in complexion, so is my heart, LOL,. 
  Hmmm, okay one day I got drunk, and she took care of me, and also we started having issues, so, she visited ifeanyi, regularly, which made me feel bad, oh Jesus, I’m saying too much, 
  Ok, she overdid it, and I broke up , told her I wasn’t interested anymore, she begged, stuffs happened and I ended up being at the begging side.
  Strike came, I invited her to my sister’s wedding, she came, I asked her out, she agreed, after series of pleading though, strike over, we resumed, I ignored her, acted like I didn’t care unknowingly to me though, then, she broke up with me, I cried, bla, bla,.. begged her to come back, she didn’t agree, bla,bla, 
  I skipped so many parts, especially my shitty attitudes, trust me, you don’t want to hear them,  I was the Devil, without horns.
  Well,  the breakup affected me a lot, I felt my body organs were missing, I read books , 48 laws of power, the subtle art of not giving a fuck, everything is fucked, the strength in our scars, how to read someone like a book, models, emotions, the art of loneliness, I read so many self-help books, they helped though, I came to realize, I caused it all, I tampered with her mental health, I saw my flaws, but then, I also realized, we can’t be with each other, she’s cool, she’s nice, anyone will be lucky to have her, but not me, I want her though but things won’t work out, cause of our past experiences with each other, well well, she has a boyfriend now, and I’m 97% sure, I’ve moved on, I wish I can turn back the hands of time, which is impossible, i think, I won’t make same mistake twice, never, if love comes my way, which I now believe is quite impossible, cause I no longer feel attraction towards anyone, except sexual attraction, but if it comes my way, I’ll be nice. Really nice.
  Well, part of the journey is the end, (iron-man quote), so this is it. Like I said I skipped a lot, especially the trashy parts.
  All I just typed is completely bullshit, just a boring story, but I’m getting faster, the more I type. </p> 
  <p>My Brain: Damn, that was long, well I your hands just sent a message to me, he’s tired, take a nap, till Dr. Alade calls. 
  BRAIN SHUTTING DOWN………….</p>
